# Unit 4 - Personal Narrative

## Introduction

Images are often used to portray our personal experiences and interests. We also use image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of an image. When combined into collages and presentations, these images tell a story about who we are and what is important to us. Your goal is to create a personal narrative using The Theater that consists of images of your personal experiences and/or interests, incorporates data related to these experiences and/or interests that can be organized in a 2D array, and uses image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of your images.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, two-dimensional (2D) arrays, and algorithms to create your personal narrative collage or animation:

- **Create at least two 2D arrays** – Create at least two 2D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use Image Filters** - Include multiple image filters learned from this unit, and additionally create new ones of your own.
- **Use methods in the String class** – Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to determine whether the name of an image file contains specific characters.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Video

Record a short video of your story to display here on your README. You can do this by:

- Screen record your project running on Code.org.
- Upload that recording to YouTube.
- Take a thumbnail for your image.
- Upload the thumbnail image to your repo.

## Story Description

This story follows and presents all the movies that I watched from the months of June- December in 2024. The program displays a intro screen with a coressponding sound effect then goes to stating a month and the movies I watched. After a month is finsihed, it then shows the cover art and the score of the top movie, or highest scored movie in said month. After all months have 
been presented, the next slide shows the total scores for each star rating, then leading to a Thank You slide at the end. 

## Image Filter Analysis

My program overall used 3 filiters, pixelate, keepColor, and colorize. The keepColor method changes the pixels by setting 2 of the coressponding blue, green, or red, values to 0 to only let 
one color remain the same on the image. Another method that I used was the Colorize method, which takes the pixels of an image and notes the grey value of each pixel, and if it is higher or 
lower value, it will be changed to a coressponding color: green, blue, or red.
